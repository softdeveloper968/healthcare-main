Once the race is started, clicking on the name of a competitor will mark them as completing a lap.
Once they have completed a lap, the following statistics about them should be updated and
displayed

1. The total number of laps they have completed to that point
2. The total time they have taken to that point (presented in mm:ss.sss format, where
mm is minutes, ss is seconds, and sss is milliseconds)
3. The average time for their laps, this is total time divided by lap count, so for example
if they have taken 1 minute to complete 3 laps, their average time is 20 seconds, which
should be shown as 0:20.000
4. The time taken for their last lap, again presented in mm:ss.sss format


There should be no limit on the number of laps that competitors complete. Once the race has
finished, clicking End Race should display the following statistics below the race controls:
1. The name of the competitor that had the highest lap count and lowest overall time
2. The name of the competitor with the fastest (completed) lap and the time taken for it
