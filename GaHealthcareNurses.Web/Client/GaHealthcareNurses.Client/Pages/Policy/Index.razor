    Background Checks<br /><br />

    1.	Ushealthcarenurses Providers Can Order or Authorize Background Checks about Themselves and Can Authorize the Sharing of Them with Other Members<br />
    Ushealthcarenurses.com offers to individuals who have registered as Ushealthcarenurses Providers and Ushealthcarenurses Seekers one or more background check services from third-party consumer reporting agencies ("Background Checks"). Certain background checks may be made available for purchase by both Ushealthcarenurses Seekers and Ushealthcarenurses Providers, while others may only be made only be available for purchase by Ushealthcarenurses Seekers or Ushealthcarenurses Providers. All background checks require payment of a separate fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request and are subject to the consent of the Ushealthcarenurses Provider on whom the check is being performed.
    <br />
    Each of these Background Checks is regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from these services are considered "consumer reports" under FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.
    <br />
    Ushealthcarenurses.com will receive a copy of each Background Check you order or authorize through Ushealthcarenurses.com. You are responsible for making sure that the email address you provide to Ushealthcarenurses.com is correct, knowing that sensitive information will be sent to it.
    <br />
    If you are a Ushealthcarenurses Provider and you authorize a third-party background check ordered by a Ushealthcarenurses Seeker, the results of that background check will be made available to the Ushealthcarenurses Seeker who ordered it, regardless of its contents.
    <br />
    If you are a Ushealthcarenurses Provider and you have ordered a Background Check on yourself from a third-party consumer reporting agency through Ushealthcarenurses.com, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the results with any other site visitor or Registered User without your specific authorization.<br />
    2. Background Check Offerings Available to Individuals Who May Not Have Registered As Ushealthcarenurses Providers or Ushealthcarenurses Seekers<br />
    Through certain pages of the Site, we may from time to time offer to individuals who may or may not be registered as Ushealthcarenurses Seekers the opportunity to purchase certain background checks on Ushealthcarenursesgivers who are not necessarily registered on Ushealthcarenurses.com. These background checks are performed by a third-party consumer reporting agency and are subject to the terms of Background Checks 1- 5, and that (i) references to Ushealthcarenurses Seekers shall refer to individuals who order the checks regardless of whether they are registered as Ushealthcarenurses Seekers, (ii) references to Ushealthcarenurses Providers shall refer to individuals who authorize the check to be performed on themselves regardless of whether they are registered as Ushealthcarenurses Providers, and (iii) Ushealthcarenurses.com does not view the results of these checks regardless of whether the Ushealthcarenursesgiver on whom the check is performed is registered as a Ushealthcarenurses Provider.<br />
    3. Special Responsibilities of Users of Background Check under FCRA<br />
    The use of any background check reports obtained through the Site is governed by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") and certain state laws. If you order or request access to background check on a Ushealthcarenurses Seeker, you are considered an end user of the check, and must agree to a required End User Certification before the check will be processed. This End User Certification requires you to certify that you will comply with the FCRA and any applicable state laws, and summarizes key legal obligations. A summary of your responsibilities in using the information contained the background check can be found http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-…know. If there is negative data in a check you receive, and you choose to take "adverse action" (i.e. if you choose to pass on that individual's candidacy) on the basis of this negative data, you must agree to take certain procedural steps, which can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-…know. These include notifying the individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject's right to contest the accuracy or completeness of the report. Depending on the specific background check you order, Ushealthcarenurses.com may provide a mechanism for you to request that the consumer reporting agency who performed the check complete these steps on your behalf. Where such a mechanism is not available, you are responsible for making any required notifications yourself. If the subject contests the report with the consumer reporting agency, you are required to suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the accuracy and completeness of the report.
                                                                       <br />

Ushealthcarenurses.com reserves the right to terminate your membership based on the information contained in such report, even if such information was subsequently dismissed.<br />

    Safety<br /><br />

    We background check all caregivers<br /><br />
    During our screening process, all caregivers are required to complete our background check -BackgroundCheck - to join our platform. All caregivers then have a BackgroundCheck on their profile, which displays the date the backgroundCheck was run.<br /><br />

    BackgroundCheck includes:<br />
    Social Security number trace<br />
    National sex offender public website search<br />
    Multi-jurisdictional criminal database search<br />
    Federal and county criminal records search<br />
    BackgroundCheck is a great start. But we strongly recommend families run checks of their own to make the best hiring decisions. We offer a suite of additional background check options for purchase, including a Criminal+ Motor Vehicle Records check. When you run an additional check, you get access to the full report so you can make the best hiring decision for your family.<br /><br />

In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.<br /><br />

    Billing and payments<br /><br />

    We use third party payment processors to assist us in processing your payment information securely. Such third party processors' use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.<br /><br />

    Managing information<br /><br />

    You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.<br /><br />

    Disclosure of information<br /><br />

    Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.<br /><br />

    We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.<br /><br />

    In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.<br /><br />

    Retention of information<br /><br />

    We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.<br /><br />

    The rights of users<br /><br />

In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.

    Privacy of children<br /><br />

    Cookies<br /><br />

    The Services use "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br /><br />

    We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Services. You may learn more about cookies and how they work in this guide.<br /><br />

    Do Not Track signals<br /><br />

    Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The Services do not track its visitors over time and across third party websites. However, some third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.<br /><br />

    Advertisements<br /><br />

    We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information about our customers that we or our advertisers collect through your use of the Services. We do not share personally identifiable information about individual customers with advertisers. In some instances, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements to the intended audience.<br /><br />

    We may also permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on the Services. These companies may deliver ads that might place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.<br /><br />

    Affiliates<br /><br />

    We may engage in affiliate marketing and have affiliate links present on the Services. If you click on an affiliate link, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of commissions.<br /><br />

    Email marketing<br /><br />

    We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties except as allowed in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.<br /><br />

    In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.<br /><br />

    Links to other resources<br /><br />

    The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.<br /><br />

    Information security<br /><br />

    We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.<br /><br />

    Data breach<br /><br />

    In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Services, send you a text or an email.<br /><br />

    Changes and amendments<br /><br />

    We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Services from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.<br /><br />

    You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Services.<br /><br />

    DMCA policy<br /><br />

    This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy ("Policy") applies to the UShealthcarenures.com website ("Website"), "UShealthcarenurses" mobile application ("Mobile Application") and any of their related products and services (collectively, "Services") and outlines how UShealthcarenurses LLC ("UShealthcarenurses LLC", "we", "us" or "our") addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you ("you" or "your") may submit a copyright infringement complaint.<br /><br />

    Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website.<br /><br />

    What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint
    <br /><br />
    Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.
    <br /><br />
    Please note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.
    <br /><br />
    We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to use an agent to report infringing material for you.
    <br /><br />
    Notifications of infringement<br /><br />

    If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification ("Notification") using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA by providing us with the following information:
    <br /><br />
    - Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by this Notification, you may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed.<br />
    - Identification of the infringing material and information you claim is infringing (or the subject of infringing activity), including at a minimum, if applicable, the URL or URLs of the web pages where the allegedly infringing material may be found.<br />
    - Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.<br />
    - A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or the law.<br />
    - A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.<br />
    - A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.<br /><br>

    All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a DMCA takedown notice generator or other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of your Notification.<br /><br>

    Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers’ accounts.
    <br /><br>
    If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.
    <br /><br>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, UShealthcarenurses LLC reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.
    <br /><br>
    Counter-notifications<br /><br>

    A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a counter-Notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it means that the material described in the Notification has been removed from our Services or access to the material has been restricted. Please take the time to read through the Notification, which includes information on the Notification we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notifications.
    <br /><br>
    To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a written communication that sets out the information specified in the list below:
    <br /><br>
    - Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been restricted and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was restricted.<br />
    - Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.<br />
    - A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or restricted as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or restricted.<br />
    - A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which the address is located (or if you are outside of the United States, that you consent to the jurisdiction of any judicial district in which the service provider may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person or company who provided the original infringement notification.<br />
    - A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.<br /><br />

    Please note that you may be liable for, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is not infringing the copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a counter-notification.
    <br /><br />
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, UShealthcarenurses LLC reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a counter-notification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), we may forward it to the person who filed the original Notification.
    <br /><br />
    The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.
    <br /><br />
    Changes and amendments<br /><br />

    We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Policy on the Services. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
    <br /><br />
